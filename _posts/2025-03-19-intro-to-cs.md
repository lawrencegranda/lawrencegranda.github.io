Let's get one thing straight: I was supposed to be a finance bro.

Not a programmer. Not an engineer.  Not someone wrestling with C code at 2 AM, questioning his life choices.

I was supposed to be wearing tailored suits, throwing around words like "synergy," and passionately arguing over stock market trends.

You know those folks who claim they were coding in Python before they could ride a bike? The ones who boast about creating their first game at age seven? Well... that wasn't me. Not even close.

I grew up in A Coruña, Spain, where the closest thing to an algorithm I ever encountered was estate planning charts and financial models. My family talks about business the way other families talk about soccer. At the dinner table, we weren't discussing Messi's latest goal--we were debating real estate strategies and startup investments.

And honestly? I loved it.

Numbers made sense to me. They were clean, predictable, governed by clear rules. None of that subjective nonsense—just logic, patterns, and formulas that worked the same way every time. My kind of deal.

So naturally, I figured I'd follow the path laid out in front of me: estate planning, real estate, startups.

Pause.

Until, well... I didn't.

## The Estate Planner Mindset: My First Love

When other kids were dreaming of being astronauts, actors, or professional soccer players, I was busy obsessing over real estate investments and startup pitches. (Yes, I was that kid.)

While my friends were collecting Pokémon cards, I was collecting tidbits from my dad's conversations about estate planning and startup investments. He'd talk about business strategies at dinner, and I'd soak it all up like a sponge. Not because I had to—because I wanted to.

I still vividly remember the day my dad took me to my first business leadership conference. I was 11 years old, dressed in a way-too-formal suit, sitting in a room of 200+ adults in their 40s and 50s. For three straight hours, I watched these professionals argue over economic forecasts, interest rates, and market trends like they were discussing the Champions League final.

Now, I might regret showing this picture, but here goes nothing. Imagine a tiny version of me, looking like a miniature CEO, trying to make sense of all the business jargon. Spoiler: I didn't, but I sure looked the part!

**[Insert Image: Me as a kid in a suit at the conference]**

Did I understand half of what they were saying? Not even close.  
Did I love every second of it? Absolutely.

That day, I was convinced: finance was my future. Or so I thought.

## The Engineering Detour

But then, out of nowhere, a plot twist: Physics.

I was fascinated by the idea that a single equation could describe how the entire universe worked. That kind of precision? That kind of elegance? It felt like magic.

Suddenly, Engineering Physics became my new obsession.

A big part of that came from my aunt and uncle, both physicists, who had an infectious enthusiasm for science. My aunt, a high school physics teacher, would always have Veritasium videos playing in the background whenever I visited. And let me tell you--there's something incredibly addictive about watching someone explain why the universe does what it does, especially when they're genuinely excited about it.

Then came my aerospace engineering phase.

Physics was fascinating, sure—but rockets? Rockets were on another level. The idea of designing machines that literally defy gravity? That was the ultimate challenge. Plus, let's be real: casually dropping "I design spacecraft for a living" into conversations? Instant cool factor.

So that was the new plan.

At least, until everything changed.

## The Big Move: Culture Shock 101

At 16, I made one of the biggest decisions of my life—packing up and moving from Spain to The Woodlands, Texas, to live with my mom, sister, and stepdad.

If you've never moved to a new country as a teenager, let me paint a picture for you:

One day, you're in Spain, speaking Spanish, eating dinner at 10 PM, and living life as a civilized human being.

The next, you're in Texas, scratching your head over phrases like "raining cats and dogs," eating dinner at 6 PM (seriously, who does that?) wondering if I was about to be tucked into bed right after, and trying to figure out why everyone is obsessed with high school football.

Culture shock is real, my friends.

Everything was different—the grading system, the class structure, the social dynamics. But the biggest twist of all? The thing that changed the entire trajectory of my life? A random elective choice.

## The High School Spark: "Wait, This is Actually Fun"

And then, with no fanfare, no dramatic music, and certainly no life plan—coding entered the chat.

I signed up for Computer Science 101 because I needed an elective. That's it. No grand ambitions. No deep passion. Just a scheduling convenience.

**Top Tip:** Some of life's best decisions happen completely by accident.

The first time I wrote a program—just a simple "Hello, World!"—I felt something click. This was different. It was a small taste of what was to come.

Around the same time, I joined the robotics club, initially drawn by the allure of aerospace engineering. I was convinced that designing robots was my destiny, so naturally, I dove into CAD (Computer-Aided Design) with all the enthusiasm of a kid in a candy store.

And let me tell you, I was good at it. I mean, really good. But here's the catch: it was the most tedious task ever.

Imagine spending six painstaking hours designing the perfect part--every measurement aligned, every angle precise. You’re a digital Michelangelo.

And then, with one innocent click? *Boom*. Software crash. Hours gone. Your soul leaves your body.

Welcome to CAD.

CAD felt like a never-ending cycle of boredom. And the manual work? My patience for repetitive tasks was as fragile as a wet paper towel.

And the lab tools? Terrifying. I was convinced that one wrong move and I'd end up losing a finger or setting something on fire. Spoiler: I never did, but the fear was real.

By senior year, I transitioned to programming and led a team. It was a revelation. I found myself more engaged and excited about the possibilities of what we could create with code. Leading the team was a challenge, but it was also incredibly rewarding. I discovered a passion for problem-solving and innovation that I hadn't felt before.

So, while CAD taught me precision and patience (sort of), it also taught me that maybe, just maybe, aerospace engineering wasn't my true calling. And that's when coding swooped in to save the day.

In the robotics club, I quickly realized that dealing with physical components wasn't my thing; I preferred the abstract nature of coding. Searching for a broken wire was frustrating, but hunting down a bug in the code? That was exhilarating. The first time we got our robot to move after countless hours of debugging and failed attempts was incredibly rewarding.

And so, somewhere between CS class, robotics, and late-night coding sessions, it became clear: I enjoyed writing code far more than working with CAD.

## The College Decision: Why Cornell? Why CS?

By the time college applications rolled around, I had my heart set on Stanford, MIT, Harvard—the dream schools.

Reality check: Stanford, MIT, and Harvard all took one look at my application and said, 'Nah, we're good.' Even UT Austin ghosted me like a bad Tinder match.

Rejections? No problem. I'd sat through business conferences as an 11-year-old in a suit--I knew what resilience looked like.

It was a gut punch. I lost motivation for a while.

Then something changed: CS50x.

Harvard's legendary intro to CS, taught by David J. Malan, was the course that reignited my passion. His energy, teaching style, and problem-solving approach were exactly what I needed. I even dreamed about meeting him in person one day.

That dream never happened, but just when I thought all hope was lost...

I got into Cornell.  
- Strong CS program? Check.  
- Ivy League? Check.  
- Financial aid? Check.

It was an easy choice.

And the deeper I got into CS, the more I realized: coding is way more than just logic and math.

## Finding the Art in Code

For the longest time, I thought programming was just about rules, logic, and efficiency. But the more I coded, the more I saw its creative side.  
- A well-designed algorithm? It's like poetry.  
- Writing clean, efficient code? It's an art form.  
- Automating something so you never have to do it manually again? Pure magic.

The moment that sealed it for me?

I was working on a personal project, fully in the zone, coding until 3 AM, completely losing track of time. That was it. That was flow.

I had finally found my thing.

## What I Learned From All Those Pivots

Looking back, my journey makes zero sense on paper. Finance, physics, aerospace, CS—it's all over the place.

But here's what I've realized: Every detour taught me something valuable.  
- Finance gave me an analytical mindset.  
- Engineering taught me how to break down complex problems.  
- Computer Science? That's where I found what I actually love doing.

Your career path doesn't have to be a straight line.

Mine looks more like a toddler's crayon drawing—messy, chaotic, full of unexpected turns. And honestly? That's what made it fun.

So if you're pivoting for the tenth time, wondering if you've wasted years chasing the wrong dream—congrats. You're right on track. Now go make it a story worth telling.
